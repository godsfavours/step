      <p>Hi, I'm Godsfavour Simon. I am an incoming second year student at Stanford University,
        working as a Google STEP intern this summer. I was raised in Imo State, Nigeria, and moved to the 
        United States with my family when I was 10. I've always loved being surrounded by and 
        playing with technology, and I'm very excited to continue to do it in this manner this
        summer.
      </p>     
  
      <p> In my free time, I love playing videogames, reading, exercising or playing sports,
        and watching tv shows! I am currently playing the story mode of Red Dead Redemption 2,
        and it is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played. On the topic of reading,
        I am currently reading personal development books, and this week I'm going through "Addicted to
        the Monkey Mind" by JF Benoist. I love playing soccer and sprinting in track & field. One of
        my goals for my time at Stanford is to make the track and field team.</p>
      
        <p> Thanks for  taking the time to visit my portfolio!</p>
